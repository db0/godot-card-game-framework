# * SCALED means that the cards simply scale up when moused over in the hand

# * auto: Will choose a shuffle animation depending on the amount of
#	cards in the pile.
# * none: No shuffle animation for this pile.
# * random: Will choose a random shuffle style each time a shuffle is requested.
# * corgi: Looks better on a small amount of cards (0 to 30)
# * splash: Looks better on a moderate amount of cards (30+)
# * snap: For serious people with no time to waste.
# * overhand: Shuffles deck in 3 vertical raises. Best fit for massive amounts (60+)
