# Script Definition Keys
#
# The below are all the possible dictionary keys that can be set in a
# task definition.
# Most of them are only relevant for a specific task type
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# Determines which card, if any, this script will try to affect.
#
# If key does not exist, we set value to [],  thereogr assuming
# there's no card subjects needed for the task.
#
# If you need to adjust the amount of cards modified by the script
# also use [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT)
const KEY_SUBJECT := "subject"
# If this is the value of the [KEY_SUBJECT](#KEY_SUBJECT) key,
# we initiate targetting from the owner card
const KEY_SUBJECT_V_TARGET := "target"
# If this is the value of the [KEY_SUBJECT](#KEY_SUBJECT) key,
# then the task affects the owner card only.
const KEY_SUBJECT_V_SELF := "self"
# If this is the value of the [KEY_SUBJECT](#KEY_SUBJECT) key,
# during [KEY_ALTERANTS](#KEY_ALTERANTS) scripts using [KEY_PER](#KEY_PER)
# then the script will check against trigger card only.
#
# If this is the value of the [KEY_SUBJECT](#KEY_SUBJECT) key,
# during normal scripts tasks then the
# tasks that do not match the triggers will be skipped
# but the script will still pass its cost check
# This allows the same trigger, to have different tasks firing, depending
# on the trigger card.
const KEY_SUBJECT_V_TRIGGER := "trigger"
# If this is the value of the [KEY_SUBJECT](#KEY_SUBJECT) key,
# then we search all cards on the table
# by node order, and return candidates equal to

#
# Used with the [mod_counter](ScriptingEngine#mod_counter) task to specify
# Which counter to modify with this task
const KEY_COUNTER_NAME := "counter_name"
# Value Type: bool (Default = false).
#
# Used when a script is using one of the following tasks:

# Used in conjunction with the following tasks
# * [add_grid](ScriptingEngine#add_grid)
#
# This is the path to the scene we will add to the game.
const KEY_SCENE_PATH := "scene_path"
# Value Type: String

#
# This is name of the card that will be added to the game.
const KEY_CARD_NAME := "card_name"
# Value Type: int
#
# Used by the [ask_integer](ScriptingEngine#ask_integer) task.
# Specifies the minimum value the number needs to have
const KEY_ASK_INTEGER_MIN := "ask_int_min"
# Value Type: int
#
# Used by the [ask_integer](ScriptingEngine#ask_integer) task.
# Specifies the maximum value the number needs to have
const KEY_ASK_INTEGER_MAX := "ask_int_max"
# Value Type: Array of Strings
# All card manipulation Signals will send a list of tags
# marking the type of effect that triggered them.
#
# By Default it's the tags sent is just ["Manual"]
# for manipulation via the core API methods.
# However when the manipulation is done via ScriptingEngine, the tags
# can be modified by the script defintion. The ScrptingEngine will always
# mark them as "Scripted" instead of "Manual" at the least.
#
# With this key, you can specify a number of keywords
# you can assign to your script, which details what function it is serving.
# These can be hooked on by the [AlterantEngine] and the [ScriptingEngine]
# to figure out if this script effects should be altered or triggered.
#
# Tags specified with ScriptTasks will be injected along with list sent
# by the ScriptingEngine. So for example `"tags": ["PlayCost"]`
# will be sent as ["Scripted", "PlayCost"] by the ScriptingEngine.
#
# A signal or script has to have all the tags a
# [FILTER_TAGS](#FILTER_TAGS) task is looking for, in order to be considered.
const KEY_TAGS := "tags"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# Used in place of a trigger name (e.g. 'manual'). This key allows the card to be marked as
# an "Alterant". I.e. a card which will modify the values of other scripts or
# effects.
#
# For example cards which reduce or increase costs,
# or cards which intensify the effect of other cards would be alterants.
#
# The dictionary inside follows a similar format to a typical script,
# with the [state_exec](Card#get_state_exec) of the card being the next key,
# specifying when the alterant is active, and inside that,
# an array of mulitple alterants to check against.
#
# A sample alterant definition might look like this
#```
#{"alterants": {
#	"board": [
#		{"filter_task": "mod_counter",
#		"trigger": "another",
#		"filter_tags": ["PlayCost"],
#		"filter_counter_name": "research",
#		"filter_state_trigger": [{
#			"filter_properties": {"Type": "Science"}
#		}],
#		"alteration": -1}
#	]
#}}
#```
# The above would roughly translate to *"Whenever you are playing a Science card
# reduce it's research cost by 1"*
#
# The main difference from other scripts being that
# triggers are checked inside each individual alterant task,
# rather than on the whole script. This allows the same card
# to modify different sort of cards and triggers, in different ways.
#
# Currently the following tasks support being altered during runtime via alterants
# * [mod_tokens](ScriptingEngine#mod_tokens)
# * [mod_counter](ScriptingEngine#mod_counter)
# * [spawn_card](ScriptingEngine#spawn_card)
#
# When this is used [KEY_ALTERATION](KEY_ALTERATION) also needs to be defined.
const KEY_ALTERANTS := "alterants"
# Value Type: int
#
# Used by the [AlterantEngine] to determine by how much it should modify
# the currently performed task.
#
# It can accept a [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) value which allows one to script an
# effect like "Increase the cost by the number of Soldiers on the table"
const KEY_ALTERATION := "alteration"
# This is a versatile value that can be inserted into any various keys
# when a task needs to calculate the amount of subjects to look for
# or the number of things to do, based on the state of the board at that point
# in time.
# The value has to be appended with the type of seek to do to determine
# the amount. The full value has to match one of the following keys:
# * [KEY_PER_TOKEN](#KEY_PER_TOKEN)
# * [KEY_PER_PROPERTY](#KEY_PER_PROPERTY)
# * [KEY_PER_TUTOR](#KEY_PER_TUTOR)
# * [KEY_PER_BOARDSEEK](#KEY_PER_BOARDSEEK)
# * [KEY_PER_COUNTER](#KEY_PER_COUNTER)
#
# When this value is set, the relevant key **must** also exist in the
# Script definition. They key shall contain a dictionary which will
# Specify the subjects as well as the things to count.
#
# Inside the per_ key, you again have to specify [KEY_SUBJECT](#KEY_SUBJECT)
# lookup which is relevant for the per search.
#
# This allows us to calculate the effects of card scripts during runtime.
# For a complex example:
#```
#{"manual":
#	{"hand": [
#		{"name": "move_card_to_container",
#		"subject": "index",
#		"subject_count": "per_boardseek",
#		"src_container": deck,
#		"dest_container": hand,
#		"subject_index": "top",
#		"per_boardseek": {
#			"subject": "boardseek",
#			"subject_count": "all",
#			"filter_state_seek": [
#				{"filter_properties": {
#					"Power": 0}
#				}
#			]
#		}}
#	]}
#}
#```
# The above example can be tranlated to:
# *"Draw 1 card for each card with 0 power on the board"*
#
# When used in modify_properties, the VALUE_PER can be appended by a plus sign as well
#```
#{"manual":
#	{"board": [
#		{
#			"name": "modify_properties",
#			"set_properties": {"Power": "+per_counter"},
#			"subject": "self",
#			"per_counter": {"counter_name": "research"}
#		},
#	]}
#}
#```
# The above example can be tranlated to:
# *"Increase this card's power by the amount of research you have"*
#
# Note using a minus-sign '-' in place of a plus-sign will not work as expected.
# Use [KEY_IS_INVERTED](#KEY_IS_INVERTED) instead
const VALUE_PER := "per_"
# Value Type: Float/Int
#
# Used to multiply per results.
# This allows us to craft scripts like
# "Gain 2 Health per card on the table"
const KEY_MULTIPLIER := "multiplier"

#
# Used to divide per results.
# This allows us to craft scripts like
# "Gain 1 Health per two cards on the table"

# task to limit execution, only to cards in the right state ("board","hand" or "pile)
#
# If this is not defined, it will execute the specified exec_trigger of the
# state the card is currently in, if any exists for it.
const KEY_REQUIRE_EXEC_STATE := "require_exec_state"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# This key is used in [execute_scripts](ScriptingEngine#execute_scripts)
# to temporary alter the value of a counter by a specified amount.
#
# The value has to be a Dictionary where each key is an counter's name
# and the value is the modification to use on that counter.
const KEY_TEMP_MOD_COUNTERS := "temp_mod_counters"
# Value Type: Dictionary

# by a specified amount.
#
# The value has to be a Dictionary where each key is an number property's name

# and the value is the modification to use on that number
const KEY_TEMP_MOD_PROPERTIES := "temp_mod_properties"
# Value Type: Bool (Default = false)
#
# Used in the per dictionary to specify that the amount of things counted
# should be returned negative.
# This allows to have costs based on the boardstate
const KEY_IS_INVERTED := "is_inverted"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# A [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) key for perfoming an effect equal to a number of tokens on the subject(s)

const KEY_PER_PROPERTY := "per_property"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# A [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) key for perfoming an effect equal to a number

#
# Typically the [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT)

# but a [FILTER_STATE](#FILTER_STATE) should also be typically specified
const KEY_PER_TUTOR := "per_tutor"
# Value Type: Dictionary
#
# A [VALUE_PER](#VALUE_PER) key for perfoming an effect equal the number of
# cards on the board matching a filter.
#
# Typically the [KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT](#KEY_SUBJECT_COUNT)

#
# Key is used typically to do comparisons during filters involving

# Filter Definition Keys

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Value Type: Array
#
# Filter used for checking against the Card state
#
# The name of this key is left open ended, as the check can be run either
# against the trigger card, or the subjects card.
#
# One of the following strings **has** to be appended at the end of this string:
# * "trigger": Will only filter cards triggering this effect via signals
#	or cards triggering an alterant effect.
# * "subject": Will only filter cards that are looked up as targets for the effect.
# * "seek": Will only filter cards that are automatically sought on the board.
# * "tutor": Will only filter cards that are automaticaly sought in a pile.
#
# see [check_validity()](#check_validity-static)
#
# The content of this value has to be an array of dictionaries
# The different elements in the array act as an "OR" check. If **any** of the
# dictionary filters matches, then the card will be considered a valid target.
#
# Each filter  dictionary has to contain at least one of the various FILTER_ Keys
# All the FILTER_ keys act as an "AND" check. The Dictionary filter will only
# match, if **all** the filters requested match the card's state.
#
# This allows a very high level of flexibility in filtering exactly the cards
# required.
#
# Here's a particularly complex script example that can be achieved:
#```
#"manual": {
#	"hand": [
#		{"name": "rotate_card",
#		"subject": "boardseek",
#		"subject_count": "all",
#		"filter_state_seek": [

#			],
#			"filter_properties": {"Type": "Barbarian"}},
#			{"filter_properties": {"Type": "Soldier"}}
#		],
#		"degrees": 90}

# This example would roughly translate to the following ability:

# at least 1 blood token, as well as all soldiers."*

# It contains a list of dictionaries, each detailing a token state that
# is wished on this subject. If any of them fails to match, then the whole
# filter fails to match.
#
# This allows us to check for multiple tokens at once. For example:
# "If target has a blood and a void token..."

# The below sample script, will rotate all cards which have
# any number of void tokens and exactly 1 bio token, 90 degrees

# Value Type: Dictionary.
#
# Filter key used for checking against card_properties_modified details.
#
# Checking for modified properties is a bit trickier than other filters
# A signal emited from modified properties, will include as values the

#
# The filter specified in the card script definition, will have
# as the requested property filter, a dictionary inside the card_scripts
# with the key [FILTER_MODIFIED_PROPERTIES](#FILTER_MODIFIED_PROPERTIES).
#
# Inside that dictionary will be another dictionary with one key per
# property. That key inside will (optionally) have yet another dictionary
# within, with specific values to filter. A sample filter script for triggering
# only if a specific property was modified would look like this:
# ```
#{"card_properties_modified": {
#	"hand": [{

#		"subject": "self",
#		"set_faceup": false
#	}],
#	"filter_modified_properties":
#		{
#			"Type": {}
#		},
#	"trigger": "another"}
#}
# ```
# The above example will trigger only if the "Type" property of another card
# is modified. But it does not care to what value the Type property changed.
#
# A more advanced trigger might look like this:
# ```
#{"card_properties_modified": {
#	"hand": [{
#		"name": "flip_card",
#		"subject": "self",
#		"set_faceup": false

#			"new_value": "Orange",
#			"previous_value": "Green"
#		}
#	},

# another card, and only if it changed from "Green" to "Orange"
