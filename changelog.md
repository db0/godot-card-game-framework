In case you're wondering why the FocusHighlight node has two children panel nodes, instead of making it itself a Panel node.

This is because of https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/32030 which doesn't not consistently apply glow effects to vertical lines.

As such, I had to create the vertical and horizontal lines sepearately and apply different intensity of colour to each, to make the glow effect match.
