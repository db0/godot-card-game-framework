# The types of ScriptingEngine executions we can have
#
# * NORMAL is executing all tasks, except "is_else" tasks
# * COST_CHECK is checking if the tasks which are marked as "is_cost" can be
# fulfilled, but does not actually execute them
# * ELSE executes only tasks which are marked "is_else". This execution only
# Takes place when a COST_CHECK run discovers it cannot fulfil
# a task marked as such.

# * SCALED means that the cards simply scale up when moused over in the hand
# * VIEWPORT means that a larger version of the card appears when mousing over it
# * BOTH means SCALED + VIEWPORT

# sharing the same anchor to displace more.
# * LOWER: The CardContainer with the lowest index will be displaced more
# * HIGHER: The CardContainer with the highest index will be displaced more

# container's OverlapShiftDirection is set to "NONE"

# * NONE: This CardContainer will never be displaced from its position
# * UP: This CardContainer will be displaced upwards. Typically used when
#	this container is using one of the bottom anchors.
# * DOWN: This CardContainer will be displaced downwards.Typically used when
#	this container is using one of the top anchors.
# * LEFT: This CardContainer will be displaced leftwards. Typically used when
#	this container is using one of the right anchors.
# * RIGHT: This CardContainer will be displaced rightwards.Typically used when
#	this container is using one of the left anchors.
